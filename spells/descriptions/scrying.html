  You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same
  plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which
  is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical
  connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re casting this spell, it can
  fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

  On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell
  against it again for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
  On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the
  target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The
  sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.
  A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb
  about the size of your fist.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen
  before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that
  location and doesn’t move.
