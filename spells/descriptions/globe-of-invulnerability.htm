<p>
  An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-­‐‑foot
  radius around you and remains for the duration.
</p>
<p>
  Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect
  creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level
  spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier,
  but the spell has no effect on them.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by
  such spells.

  <span class="spell-higher-levels">At Higher Levels.</span>
  <span>
    When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the
    barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.
