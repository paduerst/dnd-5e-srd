  Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t affect
  creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level
  spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier,
  but the spell has no effect on them.

  Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by
  such spells.
