  a 45-­‐‑ degree angle, 300 feet.”

  You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you
  can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who
  is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5
  feet of you when you cast this spell.

  spell fails to teleport you.
