  Enlarge.
  <span class="p">
    The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by
    eight. This growth increases its size by one category— from Medium to Large,
    for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size,
    the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space
    available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength
    checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match
    its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with
    them deal 1d4 extra damage.

  Reduce.
  <span class="p">
    The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to
    one-­‐‑eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one
    category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target
    also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The
    target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are
    reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t
    reduce the damage below 1).
