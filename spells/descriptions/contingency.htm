  Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting
  time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the
  contingent spell—as part of casting
  <i> contingency </i>
  , expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into
  effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You
  describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a
  <i> contingency </i>
  cast with
  <i> water breathing </i>
  might stipulate that
  <i> water breathing </i>
  comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

  The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met
  for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then
  <i> contingency </i>
  ends.

  The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target
  others. You can use only one
  <i> contingency </i>
  spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another
  <i> contingency </i>
  spell on you ends.

  <i> contingency </i>
  ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.
