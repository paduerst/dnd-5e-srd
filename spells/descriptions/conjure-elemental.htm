  You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or
  water that fills a 10-­‐‑foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge
  rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied
  space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a
  bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground.

  The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

  The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll
  initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal
  commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue
  any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but
  otherwise takes no actions.

  If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn’t disappear. Instead, you
  lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your
  companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can’t be dismissed
  by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
