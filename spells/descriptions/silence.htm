  For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a
  20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any
  creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and
  creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes
  a verbal component is impossible there.
