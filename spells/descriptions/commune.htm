  Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as
  an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s
  knowledge. In a case where a one-­‐‑word answer could be misleading or
  contrary to the deity’s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an
  answer instead.

  If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest,
  there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that
  you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.
