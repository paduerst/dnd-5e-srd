  You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving
  object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something
  similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone,
  crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-­‐‑ foot
  cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

<p>
  The duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed of
  multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

<p>Material Duration</p>
<p>Vegetable matter 1 day</p>
<p>Stone or crystal 12 hours</p>
<p>Precious metals 1 hour</p>
<p>Gems 10 minutes</p>

  Using any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component
  causes that spell to fail.
