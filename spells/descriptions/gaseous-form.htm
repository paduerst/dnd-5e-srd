  and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the

  While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying speed of
  10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The
  target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength,
  Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small
  holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as
  though they were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering in
  the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

  While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate
  objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or
  otherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.
