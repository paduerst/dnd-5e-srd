  You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight.
  A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a
  sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was
  specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an
  area affected by the
  <i> alarm </i>
  spell, a
  <i> glyph of warding </i>
  , or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the
  floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

  This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You donâ€™t learn the location
  of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a
  trap you sense.
