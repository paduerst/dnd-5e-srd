  Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You
  can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the
  duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a
  trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such
  changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a
  40-­‐‑foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower
  the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and
  so

  Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area
  can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.

  This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and
  structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the
  terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.
