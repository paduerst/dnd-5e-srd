<p>
  You summon elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within
  range. You choose one the following options for what appears:
</p>
<p>
  
  <span> One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower </span>
</p>
<p>
  
  <span> Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower </span>
</p>
<p>
  
  <span> Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower </span>
</p>
<p>
  
  <span>
    Eight elementals of challenge rating 1/4 or lower. An elemental summoned by
    this spell disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
  </span>
</p>
<p>The summoned creatures are friendly to you and</p>
<p>
  your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which
  has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them
</p>
<p>
  (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they
  defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.
</p>
<p>The GM has the creatures’ statistics.</p>

  <span class="spell-higher-levels">At Higher Levels.</span>
  <span>
    When you cast this spell using certain higher-­‐‑level spell slots, you
    choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice
    as many with a 6th-­‐‑level slot and three times as many with an
    8th-­‐‑level slot.
