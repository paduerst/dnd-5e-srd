  You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the
  duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this

  If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can
  be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any
  other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration,
  or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

  If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a
  small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-­‐‑foot cube. The image can’t create
  sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect.

  Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
  things can pass through it.

  If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can
  determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
  (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the
  illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
