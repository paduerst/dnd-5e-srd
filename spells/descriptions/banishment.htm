  If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the
  target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The
  target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears
  in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is
  occupied.

  If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you’re
  on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home
  plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in
  the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is
  occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.
