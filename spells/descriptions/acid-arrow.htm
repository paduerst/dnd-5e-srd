  A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a
  spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the
  target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its
  next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much
  of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.
