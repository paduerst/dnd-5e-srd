  A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything
  as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it.
  The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming
  incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an
  Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t affected.

  At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can
  make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw
  if it’s triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.
