  A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to
  a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong
  winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the
  cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
  save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.

  Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces

  Round 3.
  <span class="p">
    You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or
    objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can’t
    be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity
    saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or
    half as much damage on a successful one.

  Round 5–10.
  <span class="p">
    Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes
    difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6
    cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and
    rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining
    concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to
    50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena
    in the area, whether mundane or magical.
