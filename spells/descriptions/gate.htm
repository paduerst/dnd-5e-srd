  You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a
  precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular
  opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the
  portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.

  The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel
  through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that
  does so is instantly transported to the other

  When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a
  pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane
  other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s
  immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied
  space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature,
  and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you,
  or help you.
