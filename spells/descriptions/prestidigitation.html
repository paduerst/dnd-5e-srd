  This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice.
  You create one of the following magical effects within range:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of
    sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small
    campfire.
  </li>
  <li>
    You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
  </li>
  <li>
    You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1
    hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface
    for 1 hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your
    hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its
  non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect
  as an action.
