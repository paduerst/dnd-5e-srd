  Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this spell shed dim
  light in a 5-­‐‑foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws, and other
  creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends.
  In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee
  attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a
  Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.
