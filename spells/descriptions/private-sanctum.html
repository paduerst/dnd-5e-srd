  You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be
  as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for
  the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.
</p>
<p>
  When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides,
  choosing any or all of the following properties:
</p>
<p>
  
  <span>
    Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  
  <span>
    The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision
    (including darkvision) through it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  
  <span>
    Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area
    or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  
  <span> Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells. </span>
</p>
<p>
  
  <span> Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. </span>
</p>
<p>
  
  <span> Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. </span>
</p>
<p>
  Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect
  permanent.
</p>

  <b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>
  <span>
    When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can
    increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th.
    Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by
    using a spell slot of 5th level.
