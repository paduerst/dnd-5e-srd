  The touch of your shadow-­‐‑wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to
  heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your
  reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit
  points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell
  ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.
