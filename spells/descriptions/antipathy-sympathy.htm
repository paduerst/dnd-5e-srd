  This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something
  within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is
  no larger than a 200-­‐‑foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent
  creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target
  with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the
  duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.
</p>
<p>
  Antipathy.
  <span>
    The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an
    intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature
    can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed
    on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains
    frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While
    frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the
    nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves
    more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no
    longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains
    sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

<p>
  Sympathy.
  <span>
    The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to
    approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the
  creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of
  its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the
  creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the target.
</p>
<p>
  If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected
  creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
</p>
<p>
  Ending the Effect.
  <span>
    If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target
    or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
    save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the
    feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature
    affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours
    while the spell persists.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1
  minute, after which time it can be affected again.
