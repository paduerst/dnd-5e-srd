  The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or
  lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly
  components. The spell simply takes effect.

  You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the
  last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate
  the new result. For example, a
  <i> wish </i>
  spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a
  friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or
  disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original
  roll.

  GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs
  in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that
  something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire
  might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence
  as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain
  were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no
  longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a
  legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence
  of the item’s current owner.

  The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating
  another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a
  spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of
  that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition,
  your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For
  each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light
  activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is
  a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast
  <i> wish </i>
  ever again if you suffer this stress.
