  You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any
  creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell
  must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must
  choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesnâ€™t protect
  the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

  If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy
  creature, this spell ends.
