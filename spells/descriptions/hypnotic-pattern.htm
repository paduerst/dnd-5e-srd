  You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a
  30-­‐‑foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes.
  Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving
  throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While
  charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

  The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone
  else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
