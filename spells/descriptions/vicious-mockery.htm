  You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature
  you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not
  understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic
  damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end
  of its next turn.
