  A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-­‐‑ hot embers appears in a
  20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud
  spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or
  until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour)
  disperses it.

  When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving
  throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
  damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when
  it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn
  there.

  The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose
  at the start of each of your turns.
