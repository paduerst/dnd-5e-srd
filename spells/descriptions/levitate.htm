  One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises
  vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The
  spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling
  creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

  The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or
  surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as
  if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in
  either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down
  as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target,
  which must remain within the spell’s range.

  When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still
  aloft.
