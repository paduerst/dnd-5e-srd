  You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous
  form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form,
  a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from
  nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the
  Dash action or to revert to its normal form.

  Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and
  can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which
  also requires the 1-­‐‑minute transformation.

  If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature
  descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely.
  If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.
