  You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power.
  The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius
  includes an area already under the effect a

  spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.

  First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter the area,
  nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any
  creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer
  charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one
  or more of those types of creatures from this effect.

  Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the
  following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects
  apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies
  to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or
  creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that
  would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or
  starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the
  creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.
