  When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your
  choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force
  damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns
  to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack
  against the same target or a different one.
