    The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force

    The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone
    or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing
    the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can
    pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone
    can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.

  Ending the Spell.
  <span class="p">
    During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a
    condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The
    condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must
    agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to
    pass.

  The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but
  otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on
  intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

  first casting is immediately freed from its binding.
