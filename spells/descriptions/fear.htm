  While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move
  away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there
  is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it
  doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving
  throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
