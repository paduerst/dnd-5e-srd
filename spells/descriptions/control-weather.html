  You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You
  must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don’t have a
  clear path to the sky ends the spell early.
</p>
<p>
  When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which are
  determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can change
  precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new
  conditions to take effect.
</p>
<p>
  Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the
  weather gradually returns to normal.
</p>
<p>
  When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the
  following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the
  wind, you can change its direction.
