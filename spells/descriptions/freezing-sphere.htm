  A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your
  choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere. Each
  creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
  save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half
  as much damage.

  If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water
  (not including water-­‐‑based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of
  6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures
  that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A
  trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell
  save DC to break free.

  You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish.
  A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in
  your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the
  globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal
  range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of
  the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1
  minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.
