  Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to
  touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the
  attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target
  takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its
  next turn.
