  You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that
  you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as
  three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target.
  A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the
  bolts.

  damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
