  This spell reverses gravity in a 50-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius, 100-­‐‑ foot high
  cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that
  aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the
  top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity
  saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.

  If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling
  objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward
  fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking
  anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.

  At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.
