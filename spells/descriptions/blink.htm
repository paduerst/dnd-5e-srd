  Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On
  a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and
  appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you
  were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the
  spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space
  of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from.
  If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the
  nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally
  near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

  While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated
  from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can’t see anything there more
  than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on
  the Ethereal Plane.

  Creatures that aren’t there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless
  they have the ability to do so.
