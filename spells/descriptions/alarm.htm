  You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an
  area within range that is no larger than a 20-­‐‑foot cube. Until the spell
  ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters
  the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that
  won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or
  audible.

  A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of
  the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.
