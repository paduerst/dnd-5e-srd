  You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the
  creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no
  effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check
  using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a
  success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.
