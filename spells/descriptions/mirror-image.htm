  Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell
  ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position
  so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to
  dismiss the illusory duplicates.

  Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s duration,
  roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your
  duplicates.

  If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the
  attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or
  higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

  A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a
  duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an
  attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends
  when all three duplicates are destroyed.

  A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies on senses
  other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as
  false, as with truesight.
