  You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can
  see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or
  fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

  The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of
  its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
