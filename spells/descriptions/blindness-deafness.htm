  You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within
  range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either
  blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its
  turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the
  spell ends.
