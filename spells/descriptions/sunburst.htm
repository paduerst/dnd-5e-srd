  Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-­‐‑foot radius centered on a point you
  choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution
  saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is
  blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and
  isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving
  throw.

  A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at
