  A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑wide,
  60-­‐‑foot-­‐‑long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution
  saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is
  blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much
  damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on
  this saving throw.

  You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the
  spell ends.

  For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds
  bright light in a 30-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
  This light is sunlight.
