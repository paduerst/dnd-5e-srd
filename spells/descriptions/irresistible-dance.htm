  A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its
  space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While
  the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack
  rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw
  to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.
