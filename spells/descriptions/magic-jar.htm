  Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the
  container you used for the spell’s material component. While your soul
  inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in
  the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The only action you
  can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either
  returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess
  a humanoids body.

  You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can
  see (creatures warded by a
  <i> protection from evil and good </i>
  or
  <i> magic circle </i>
  spell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a
  failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes
  trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to
  possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

  Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics are
  replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment
  and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of
  your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any
  of its class features.

  Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using
  its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.

  While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body
  to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host
  creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the
  creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own
  spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100
  feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

  If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns
  to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body
  is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature’s soul
  is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its
  body if the body is alive and within 100 feet.
