  You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that
  didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its soul is free and willing,
  the target returns to life with all its hit points.

  This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the
  creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses,
  and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they
  afflict the target on its return to life.

  Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all
  attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target
  finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

  Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one
  year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast
  spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks,
  and saving throws.
