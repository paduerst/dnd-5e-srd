  A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden,
  plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within
  range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the openingâ€™s dimensions: up to
  5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability
  in a structure surrounding it.

  When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage
  created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the
  surface on which you cast the spell.
