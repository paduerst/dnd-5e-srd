  You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see
  within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a
  100-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and
  structures in contact with the ground in that area.

  The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground
  that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,

  Fissures.
  <span class="p">
    Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the start of your next turn
    after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations
    chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends
    from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing
    on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or
    fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as
    it opens.

  Structures.
  <span class="p">
    The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the
    ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your
    turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it
    collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half
    the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On
    a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone,

  an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on
  the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
  much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.
