  You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6
  feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly
  inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material
  component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.

  At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item’s name and
  crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of
  physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.

  If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the sapphire
  doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn who the creature
  possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is located at that
  moment.
