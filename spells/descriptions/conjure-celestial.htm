  The celestial is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll
  initiative for the celestial, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal
  commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they
  don’t violate its alignment. If you don’t issue any commands to the celestial,
  it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
