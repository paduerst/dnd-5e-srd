  Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction
  to the creature’s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of
  you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

  The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature
  of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen
  such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you
  described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of
  a
  <i> polymorph </i>
  spell, this spell doesn’t locate the creature.

  blocks a direct path between you and the creature.
