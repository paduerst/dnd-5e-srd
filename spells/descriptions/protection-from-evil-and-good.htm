  Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against
  certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends,

  The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have
  disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also canâ€™t be
  charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed,
  frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any
  new saving throw against the relevant effect.
