  A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a
  60-­‐‑foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above
  you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the storm cloud
  could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can’t accommodate the
  cloud).

  When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of
  lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5
  feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10
  lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call
  down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

  If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell
  gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under
  such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.
