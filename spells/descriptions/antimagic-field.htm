  A 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area
  is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the
  sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic
  items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you,
  centered on you.

  Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a
  deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot
  expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
  suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts
  against its duration.

  <span class="s9"> Targeted Effects. </span>
  Spells and other magical effects, such as
  <i> magic missile </i>
  and
  <i> charm person </i>
  , that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that
  target.

  <span class="s9"> Areas of Magic. </span>
  The area of another spell or magical effect, such as
  <i> fireball </i>
  , can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the
  part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the
  flames created by a
  <i> wall of fire </i>
  are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is
  large enough.

  A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a
  target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic
  weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if
  you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere),
  the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

  <span class="s9"> Magical Travel. </span>
  Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere
  is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to
  another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an
  extradimensional space such as that created by the
  <i> rope trick </i>
  spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.

    A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of

  spells don’t nullify each other.
