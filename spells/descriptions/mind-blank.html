  Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic
  damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts,
  divination spells, and the charmed condition. The spell even foils
  <i>wish</i> spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the
  target’s mind or to gain information about the target.
