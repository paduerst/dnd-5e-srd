  You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-­‐‑sharp blades made of magical
  energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make
  a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a
  ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The
  wall provides three-­‐‑quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is
  difficult terrain.

  When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn or starts
  its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
  save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the
  creature takes half as much damage.
