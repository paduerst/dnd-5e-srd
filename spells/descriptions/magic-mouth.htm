  You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered
  when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that
  isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which
  must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10
  minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to
  deliver your message.

  When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and
  recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the
  object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for
  example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the
  words appear to come from the object’s mouth.

  When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its
  message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

  The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like,
  though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30
  feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when
  any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings
  within 30 feet of it.
