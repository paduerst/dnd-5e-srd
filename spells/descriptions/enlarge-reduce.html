<p>
  You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or
  smaller for the duration.
</p>
<p>
  Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the
  target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success,
  the spell has no effect.
</p>
<p>
  If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes
  size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size
  at once.
</p>
<p>
  Enlarge.
  <span>
    The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by
    eight. This growth increases its size by one category— from Medium to Large,
    for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size,
    the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space
    available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength
    checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match
    its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with
    them deal 1d4 extra damage.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Reduce.
  <span>
    The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to
    one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from
    Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has
    disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s
    weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced,
    the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the
    damage below 1).
