  This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast
  that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's
  Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must
  succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's
  duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends.
