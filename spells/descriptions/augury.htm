<p>
  By casting gem-­‐‑inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate
  cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an
  otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you
  plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from the following
  possible omens:
</p>
<p>
  <span>  </span>
  <i> Weal </i>
  , for good results
</p>
<p>
  <span>  </span>
  <i> Woe </i>
  , for bad results
</p>
<p>
  <span>  </span>
  <i> Weal and woe </i>
  , for both good and bad results
</p>
<p>
  <span>  </span>
  <i> Nothing </i>
  , for results that aren’t especially good or bad
</p>
<p>
  The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might
  change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or
  gain of a companion.
</p>
<p>
  If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest,
  there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that
  you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.
