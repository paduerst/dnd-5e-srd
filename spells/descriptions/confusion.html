<p>
  This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and
  provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere
  centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving
  throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
</p>
<p>
  An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of
  each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

        The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To
        determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die
        face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.

        The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly
        determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its
        reach, the creature does nothing this turn.

  At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving
  throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
