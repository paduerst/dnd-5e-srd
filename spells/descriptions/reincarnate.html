  You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the
  creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult
  body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target’s soul
  isn’t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

  The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes
  the creature’s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following
  table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the
  GM chooses a form.

  The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains
  the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original
  race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.
