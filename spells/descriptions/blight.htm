  Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see
  within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a
  Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed
  save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on
  undead or constructs.

  If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw
  with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

  If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or
  shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.
