  another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even
  break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving
  throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you
  finish a long rest. While insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand
  what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A
  <i> greater restoration </i>
  spell cast on you ends this effect.

  On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must
  ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with
  one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear”
  (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-­‐‑word
  answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an
  answer.
