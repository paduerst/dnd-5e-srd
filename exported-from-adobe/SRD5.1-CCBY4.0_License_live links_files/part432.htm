        attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time
        you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing
        the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the
        attack (you need a free hand to load a one-­‐‑handed weapon). At the end
        of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a
        minute to search the battlefield.</span

      If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee
      attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised
      Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage
      when used in this way.
