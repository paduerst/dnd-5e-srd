      You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-­‐‑foot cube. The image appears at
      a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems
      completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to
      the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause
      damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature,
      or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).
    </p>

      As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action
      to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image
      changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements
      appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a
      creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
      walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at
      different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

      Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
      things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the
      image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
      (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns
      the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and
      its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.
