      You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or
      pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy
      and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in
      order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not
      necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as
      channeling divine power.

      Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-­‐‑divine being from
      among those listed in &quot;Fantasy-­‐‑Historical Pantheons&quot; or those
      specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your
      religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
      childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high
      priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different
      way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any
      established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a
      fiendish master that you now deny.
