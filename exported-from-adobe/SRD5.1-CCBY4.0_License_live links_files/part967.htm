      The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level
      or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including
      costly components. The spell simply takes effect.

      GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what
      occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the
      likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the
      effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some
      unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For
      example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time
      to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you
      from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact
      might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.

      The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than
      duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each
      time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic
      damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented
      in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower
      already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and
      doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time
      decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are
      unable to cast <i>wish </i>ever again if you suffer this stress.
