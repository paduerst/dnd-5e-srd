      A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and
      spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as
      explained in the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>). The spellcaster level is also
      used for any cantrips included in the feature.

      The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class.
      The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as
      the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the
      druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to
      or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to
      its spell list.
    </p>
    <p
      style="
        padding-left: 10pt;

        text-align: left;
      "
    >
      A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the
      spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-­‐‑level
      <i>lightning bolt </i>spell can cast it as a 5th-­‐‑level spell by using
      one of its 5th-­‐‑level spell slots.
    </p>
    <p
      style="
        padding-left: 10pt;
        text-indent: 9pt;
        line-height: 107%;
        text-align: left;

      You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing
      any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the
      same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater
      or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.
