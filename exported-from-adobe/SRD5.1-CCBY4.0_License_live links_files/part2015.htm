      The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes.
      They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel
      from one plane to another. Spells such as <i>etherealness </i>and
      <i>astral projection </i>allow characters to enter these planes and
      traverse them to reach the planes beyond.

      The <b>Ethereal Plane </b>is a misty, fog-­‐‑bound dimension that is
      sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border
      Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every
      location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal
      Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the
      <i>see invisibility</i>

      and <i>true seeing </i>spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also
      extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly
      effects that use force energy such as <i>forcecage </i>and
      <i>wall of force. </i>The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a
      region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.

      The <b>Astral Plane </b>is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors
      travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic.
      It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps
      of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars.
      Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins.
      Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral
      Plane is an endless, open domain.
