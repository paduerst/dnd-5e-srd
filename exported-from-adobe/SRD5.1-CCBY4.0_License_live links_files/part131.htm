      A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch,
      elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew.
      Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus,
      incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.

      Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons
      and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles
      for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated
      with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole
      weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is
      associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as
      darts or javelins.

      Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other
      plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region
      might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.
