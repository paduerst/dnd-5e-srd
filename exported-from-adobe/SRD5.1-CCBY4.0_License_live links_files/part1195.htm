      While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that
      is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s
      effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored
      in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast.
      The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of
      its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb
      more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has
      no effect on that spell.

      When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the
      rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of
      spell energy it currently has stored.

      If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in
      it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can
      create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell
      slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of
      your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can
      use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-­‐‑level spell slot.

      A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A
      rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining
      becomes nonmagical.
