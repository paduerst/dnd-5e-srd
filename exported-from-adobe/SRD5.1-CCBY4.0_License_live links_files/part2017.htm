      If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the
      multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for
      such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as
      divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are
      best known as the homes of deities.

      actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea
      that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the
      Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes
      as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond
      ordinary sensory experience.

      Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive.
      Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to
      natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims
      of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the
      mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely,
      effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill
      their own needs.

      Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The
      perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can
      also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take
      a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a
      single day—if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks
      for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.

      The most well-­‐‑known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that
      correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades
      of distinction between them.
