      When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface
      (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that
      can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a
      treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of
      the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object,
      that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10
      feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell
      ends without being triggered.
    </p>

      style="
        padding-left: 10pt;

      The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation)

      You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs
      inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or
      stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching
      within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it.
      For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are
      opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing
      or reading the glyph.

    >
      You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under
      certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical
      characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example,
      the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also
      specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a
      certain password.
    </p>

      When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its
      effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius
      sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.
      Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its
      effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a
      turn or ends its turn there.
