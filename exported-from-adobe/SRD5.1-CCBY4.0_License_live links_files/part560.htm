A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-­‐‑quarters cover, the target has three-­‐‑quarters cover.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">A target with <b>half cover </b>has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">A target with <b>three-­‐‑quarters cover </b>has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-­‐‑quarters cover if about three-­‐‑quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part561.htm">Damage Rolls</a><a class="toc1" href="part562.htm">Critical Hits</a><a class="toc1" href="part563.htm">Damage Types</a><a class="toc0" href="part564.htm">Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</a><a class="toc0" href="part565.htm">Healing</a><a class="toc0" href="part566.htm">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</a><a class="toc1" href="part567.htm">Instant Death</a><a class="toc1" href="part568.htm">Falling Unconscious</a><a class="toc1" href="part569.htm">Death Saving Throws</a><a class="toc1" href="part570.htm">Stabilizing a Creature</a><a class="toc1" href="part571.htm">Monsters and Death</a><a class="toc0" href="part572.htm">Temporary Hit Points</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part559.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../SRD5.1-CCBY4.0_License_live%20links.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part561.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
