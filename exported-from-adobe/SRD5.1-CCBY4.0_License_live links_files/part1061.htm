Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-­‐‑two.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Playing Card    Card</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ace of diamonds  Vizier*</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">King of diamonds   Sun Queen of diamonds  Moon Jack of diamonds   Star Two of diamonds   Comet*</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ace of hearts    The Fates*</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King of hearts   Throne</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Queen of hearts   Key</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jack of hearts   Knight</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two of hearts    Gem*</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ace of clubs    Talons*</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">King of clubs    The Void</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Queen of clubs   Flames</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Jack of clubs    Skull</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two of clubs    Idiot*</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ace of spades   Donjon*</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">King of spades   Ruin Queen of spades   Euryale Jack of spades    Rogue</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Two of spades   Balance*</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Joker (with TM)   Fool* Joker (without TM)  Jester</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*Found only in a deck with twenty-­‐two cards</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Balance. <span class="p">Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa.

Otherwise, this card has no effect.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s9">Donjon. </span>You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a <i>wish </i>spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Euryale. <span class="p">The card’s medusa-­‐‑like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">The Fates. <span class="p">Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Flames. <span class="p">A powerful devil becomes your enemy.

This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Fool. <span class="p">You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Gem. <span class="p">Twenty-­‐‑five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Idiot. <span class="p">Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1).

The GM chooses the weapon.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Knight. <span class="p">You gain the service of a 4th-­‐‑level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Moon. <span class="p">You are granted the ability to cast the </span><span class="s12">wish</span></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">spell 1d3 times.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s9">Rogue. </span>A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a <i>wish </i>spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Ruin. <span class="p">All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Skull. <span class="p">You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1060.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../SRD5.1-CCBY4.0_License_live%20links.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1062.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
