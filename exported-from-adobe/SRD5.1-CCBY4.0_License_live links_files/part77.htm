      Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting
      bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant
      tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions
      in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.
      When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves
      questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the
      priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.

      The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in
      fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps
      such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be
      honest than politic.

      The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual
      colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore
      with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where
      they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at
      self-­‐‑important figures of authority.
