      The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the
      arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
      breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might
      find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell
      recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty
      tome in an ancient library.

      Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form
      of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the
      wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the
      sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using
      your own notation.

        example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is
        just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and
        easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to
        cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of

      If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe
      the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the
      remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as
      normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe
      place.

        collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous
