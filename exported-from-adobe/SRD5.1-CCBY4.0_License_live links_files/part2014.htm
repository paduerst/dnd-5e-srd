They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Planar &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;"><span class="s9">Spells. </span>A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. <i>Plane shift </i>and <i>gate </i>can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. <i>Etherealness </i>allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches—such as the Elemental Planes. And the <i>astral projection </i>spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Portals. <span class="p">A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-­‐‑ shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations— circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</span></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part2015.htm">Transitive Planes</a><a class="toc0" href="part2016.htm">Inner Planes</a><a class="toc0" href="part2017.htm">Outer Planes</a><a class="toc1" href="part2018.htm">Outer Planes</a><a class="toc1" href="part2019.htm">Demiplanes</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2013.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../SRD5.1-CCBY4.0_License_live%20links.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2015.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
