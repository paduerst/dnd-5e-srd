        the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to
        encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an
        adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</span

        semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation
        is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
        dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through
        years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit
        that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</span

        bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their
