If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-­‐‑hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part504.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../SRD5.1-CCBY4.0_License_live%20links.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part506.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
