Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You gain the following benefits while wearing it:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;"><span class="s14"></span> You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a component: <i>daylight </i>(opal), <i>fireball </i>(fire opal), <i>prismatic spray </i>(diamond), or <i>wall of fire </i>(ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;"><span class="p"> As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-­‐‑foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.</span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;"><span class="p"> As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.</span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;"><span class="p"> As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1104.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../SRD5.1-CCBY4.0_License_live%20links.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1106.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
