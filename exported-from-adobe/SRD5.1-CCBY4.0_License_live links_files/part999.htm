      Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their
      magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and
      certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class,
      a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the
      class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots
      and uses that class’s spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a
      spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using
      its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.

      Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature
      gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states
      otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides
      the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none
      of its magical properties.

      Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on
      only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the
      same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take
      the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous
      item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is
      interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the
      short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to
      activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary
      command words.

      An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can
      be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to
      attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an
      item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of
      an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one
      <i>ring of protection </i>at a time.

      A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer
