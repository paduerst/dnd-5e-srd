      A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic
      items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special
      ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an
      <i>arrow of dragon slaying </i>deals extra damage not only to dragons but
      also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and
      wyverns.
