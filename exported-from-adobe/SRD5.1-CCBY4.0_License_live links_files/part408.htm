Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Lawful good <span class="p">(LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Neutral good <span class="p">(NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Chaotic good <span class="p">(CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Lawful neutral <span class="p">(LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Neutral <span class="p">(N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and donâ€™t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Chaotic neutral <span class="p">(CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Lawful evil <span class="p">(LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Neutral evil <span class="p">(NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Chaotic evil <span class="p">(CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.</span></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part409.htm">Alignment in the Multiverse</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part407.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../SRD5.1-CCBY4.0_License_live%20links.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part409.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
