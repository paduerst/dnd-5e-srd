      When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost
      treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers
      face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require
      basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things
      cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

      Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost
      of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and
      drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the
      cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next
      calls.

      At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from
      the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices
      listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen
      lifestyle over a thirty-­‐‑day period, multiply the listed price by 30.
      Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the
      funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle
      throughout your character’s career.

      Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy
      lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though
      you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might
      help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful
      connections.
