      action nor your move.

      You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for
      free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open
      a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your
      weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

      If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action.
      Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to
      use, as stated in their descriptions.

      The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when
      it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For
      instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
      stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
