      A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a
      cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries,
      and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends
      some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever
      he casts spells.

      A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party
      resources, curable by a casting of <i>lesser restoration</i>. A more
      complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as
      characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal
      with the consequences.

      A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a
      plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it
      can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works arenâ€™t bound by a
      common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness
      might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A
      plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling
      neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story
      you want to tell.
