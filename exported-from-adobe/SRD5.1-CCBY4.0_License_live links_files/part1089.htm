      for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but you can remove its horns and
      use them as weapons. One horn becomes a <i>+1 lance</i>, and the other
      becomes a <i>+2 longsword</i>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the
      weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine
      form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius aura of terror
      while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn
      in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
      of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The
      frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully
      saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat’s aura for the
      next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can’t be used again
      until 15 days have passed.
