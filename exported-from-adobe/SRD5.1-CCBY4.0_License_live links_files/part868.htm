      You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to
      you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic
      power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it
      to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within
      range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name
      when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a
      different creature anyway (GM’s choice).

      When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any
      particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange
      for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range
      from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to
      complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the
      dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for
      its services.

      Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable
      donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might
      demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might
      exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

      As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a
      payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000
      gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000
      gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances
      under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s
      ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks
      typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially
      dangerous tasks might require a greater gift.

      After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-­‐‑upon duration

      back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.
