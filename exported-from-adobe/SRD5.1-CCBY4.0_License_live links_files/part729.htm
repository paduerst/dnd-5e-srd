      For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you
      cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you
      can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of
      you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or
      doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

      You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on
      its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention
      to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same
      creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving
      throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its
      emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as
      something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell
      ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and
      unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the
      creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
      contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

      Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the
      course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of
      an interrogation.

      You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures
      you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the
      duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can
      penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than
      lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with
      an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.
    </p>
    <p
      style="
        padding-left: 10pt;

      Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its
      thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you
      can’t see it, but it must still be within range.
