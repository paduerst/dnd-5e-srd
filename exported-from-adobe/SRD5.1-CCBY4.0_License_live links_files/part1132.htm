      When this 4-­‐‑foot-­‐‑tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows
      faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11,
      10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is
      destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.

      If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet
      of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It
      remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.

      Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated
      mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving
      throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one
      of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made
      with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs
      succeed on the saving throw automatically.

      An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that
      reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells
      don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped
      within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel.
      Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

      If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are
      already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to
      accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied
      space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is
      shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied
      spaces near it.

      While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name
      of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The
      creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the
      mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.
