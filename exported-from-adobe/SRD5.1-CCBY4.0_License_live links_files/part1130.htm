      Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush
      (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create
      three-­‐‑dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint
      flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its
      image.

      Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface,
      which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a
      door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons— that are up to
      10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.

      When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted
      becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates
      an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on
      a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of
      objects you create.

      Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If
      you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of
      gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made
      from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

      If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy
      appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm
      to anything.
