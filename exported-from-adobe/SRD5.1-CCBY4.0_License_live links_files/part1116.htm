      When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone
      orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you.
      Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone
      to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against
      AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an
      action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

      While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it.

      spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as
      if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored
