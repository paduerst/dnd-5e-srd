      If a creature or an object has <b>resistance </b>to a damage type, damage
      of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has
      <b>vulnerability </b>to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled
      against it.

      Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to
      damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and
      is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also
      within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first
      reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.
    </p>
    <p
      style="
        padding-left: 10pt;
        text-indent: 9pt;
        line-height: 107%;
        text-align: left;

    >
      Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same
      damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has
      resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage,
      the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature,
      not reduced by three-­‐‑ quarters.
