While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part986.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../SRD5.1-CCBY4.0_License_live%20links.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part988.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
