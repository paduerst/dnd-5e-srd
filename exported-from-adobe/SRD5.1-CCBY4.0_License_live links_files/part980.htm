      Simple Pit.
      <span class="p"
        >A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a

      The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through
      and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s
      depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).

      A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot
      traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful
      DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the
      trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.

      When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor,
      causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or
      20 feet deep but can be deeper.

      Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be
      wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as
      to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The
      cover can also be magically held shut using the <i>arcane lock </i>spell
      or similar magic.

      A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The
      cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to
      disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check
      using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the
      character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a
      secret door nearby) opens the pit.

      Spiked Pit.
      <span class="p"
        >This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened
        wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit
        takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any
        falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes.
        In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also
        make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one.</span
