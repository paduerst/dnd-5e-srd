      You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where
      it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for
      the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During
      this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every
      foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you
      originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you can’t see
      anything more than 60 feet away.

      While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other
      creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane can’t
      perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a special ability or
      magic has given them the ability to do so.

      When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated
      from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a
      solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to
      the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage
      equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.
