      A 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This
      area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse.
      Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and
      even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves
      with you, centered on you.

      Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a
      deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot
      expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
      suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts
      against its duration.

      <i>wall of fire </i>are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in
      the wall if the overlap is large enough.

      A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used
      against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If
      a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for
      example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target
      outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon
      as it exits.
