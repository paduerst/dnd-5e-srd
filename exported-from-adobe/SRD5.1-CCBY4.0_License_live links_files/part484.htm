You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part483.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../SRD5.1-CCBY4.0_License_live%20links.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part485.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
