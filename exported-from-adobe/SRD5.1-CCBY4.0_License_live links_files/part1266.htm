      Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons.
      When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked
      their greatest magic, forging five <i>Orbs of Dragonkind </i>(or
      <i>Dragon Orbs</i>) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to
      each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war
      toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to
      them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.

    >
      As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded
      into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been
      warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose
      of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of
      control over dragons.

      Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents

      While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s
      depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma
      check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you
      remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for
      as long as you remain attuned to it.

        Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as
        possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are
        unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile
        toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used
